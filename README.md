express-prefixr
===============

Node + Express Prefixr alternative

Demo: [http://expressprefixr.herokuapp.com](http://expressprefixr.herokuapp.com)

Automatically prefixes vendored properties in CSS and SCSS files, as an alternative
to [prefixr.com](http://prefixr.com).

API
-----
Express-Prefixr also exposes a public API. To use it, send a POST request to `http://expressprefixr.herokuapp.com/api/processor`, passing your stylesheet through the `css` form parameter.

Example:

```bash
~ Â» curl http://localhost:3000/api/processor -d css='body { border-radius: 10px; }'
{
     "status": "success",
     "result": "body {\n  -webkit-border-radius: 10px;\n  -moz-border-radius: 10px;\n  -ms-border radius: 10px;\n  -o-border-radius: 10px;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n}"
}
```

TODO
-----
* (Re)Add support to fragment-prefixing
